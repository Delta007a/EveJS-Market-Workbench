//! The committed price manifest and its CCP capture — `doc/JITA_INDEX_SEED_PLAN.md` §4.
//!
//! One versioned artifact (`data/price-manifest.json`, decision 7: **committed**) holding
//! the resolved price and provenance for every seeded type, plus the captured leaf prices
//! the local cost model needs to reach them.
//!
//! ```json
//! {
//!   "formatVersion": 1,
//!   "sdeBuild": 3396210,
//!   "costModel": "recursive-v1",
//!   "generatedAt": "…",
//!   "sources": { "esi": "markets/prices @ …" },
//!   "prices": { "34": { "price": 2.0, "source": "base-price" } }
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! Four rules this module exists to enforce:
//!
//! 1. **Local entries are derived, captures are permanent.** `cost-recursive` and
//!    `base-price` entries are recomputed from the SDE on every refresh, so a static-data
//!    or cost-model change flows through. A `ccp-*` entry is **never** overwritten except
//!    by an explicit `--force-refetch` (§4.3): the economy must not drift with TQ, and
//!    rebuilds must be deterministic and offline.
//! 2. **Bucket D is capture-only** (§2.4/§3.3). `cost(type) := manifest.fetchedPrice(type)`
//!    and nothing else — a D type with no capture stays **unseeded**, which is the designed
//!    outcome, not an error. It must never fall back to `basePrice`; that fallback is what
//!    [`PriceManifest::seed_price`] and [`crate::classify::Classification::junk_seedability`]
//!    exist to make impossible.
//! 3. **Unpriced means unseeded, never guessed.** The same rule as bucket D, applied to
//!    every bucket: an A∪B type with no manifest entry is [`SeedPrice::Blocked`], and
//!    [`crate::seedplan::SeedPlan`] drops it and names it rather than inventing a price.
//!    A handful of A∪B types are permanently unpriceable, so the refresh reports exactly
//!    what is blocked and which leaves are to blame, and `[index_seed] max_unpriced_drops`
//!    is what still fails the run when the drop count says the manifest itself is broken.
//! 4. **The file is a reviewable diff.** Type-id keys are numerically sorted (34 before 200
//!    before 1000, not lexicographic), the JSON is pretty-printed, and a refresh that
//!    changes nothing rewrites nothing — not even `generatedAt`.
