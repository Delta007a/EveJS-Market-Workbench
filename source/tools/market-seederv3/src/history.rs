//! Synthetic `price_history` — plan piece 12, so the client's market charts are not empty.
//!
//! ### The bug this closes
//!
//! Every v3 build so far wrote `price_history` with **zero rows**. The market daemon serves
//! that table from `query_history_rows_with_connection`
//! (`externalservices/market-server/src/state.rs:2119-2149`):
//!
//! ```sql
//! SELECT day, low_price, high_price, avg_price, volume, order_count
//!   FROM price_history WHERE type_id = ?1 ORDER BY day ASC
//! ```
//!
//! …with no limit and no station or region filter. The Node proxy then splits whatever comes
//! back into the client's "old" and "new" rowsets in `splitHistoryRows`
//! (`server/src/services/market/marketProxyService.js:429-447`): **old is every row but the
//! last, new is the last row**. So an empty table means an empty chart, and a table with one
//! single day means an empty "old" half. **At least two days must exist** for both halves to
//! be non-empty, which is why [`crate::config::HistoryConfig`] defaults to 30 and why
//! [`verify_history_table`] refuses to leave a one-day build behind.
//!
//! ### The shape, ported from v1
//!
//! The generator is v1's, verbatim in behaviour — `tools/market-seed/src/main.rs:1326-1418`
//! (`build_price_history_rows` / `write_price_history_rows`):
//!
//! ```text
//! day        = today_utc - (days - 1 - day_offset), formatted YYYY-MM-DD
//! drift      = (((type_id * 37 + day_offset * 13) % 101) - 50) / 1000     // ±5%
//! avg        = round_isk(max(base * (1 + drift), floor))
//! low        = round_isk(avg * 0.985)
//! high       = round_isk(avg * 1.015)
//! volume     = 100 + type_id % 500 + day_offset * 3
//! order_count= 10 + type_id % 20
//! ```
//!
//! It is deterministic in `(type_id, day_offset)` alone, so two builds on the same day from
//! the same seed produce byte-identical history, and it is bounded to ±5% so a chart wobbles
//! around the price the item actually sells for instead of wandering.
//!
//! ### What is different in v3: the base price is the seeded ask
//!
//! v1 drifted the SDE `basePrice`, falling back to a synthesised number when there was none.
//! That is not the price anyone pays here. v3 drifts **the price a player actually pays to
//! buy the type from the seed**: the best ask across all stations, taken from exactly the
//! same [`crate::audit::SeedBook`] the audit prices its checks off — index rows, junk rows and
//! the TQ NPC overlay together, so BPOs and skillbooks get charts too. A type seeded on the
//! bid side only (its ask was deferred to the NPC catalog, or TQ only buys it back) has no
//! ask to drift and falls back to its best bid; the count of those is reported. A type with
//! no seed row anywhere gets no history at all — an item nobody sells has no price to chart,
//! and inventing one would be the only place in this seeder that made a price up.
//!
//! ### Why one price per type is the whole story
//!
//! `price_history` is keyed `(type_id, day)` and has **no station or region column**
//! (`externalservices/market-server/crates/market-common/src/lib.rs:188-197`) — it is global
//! per type. Asks are per station, so the two do not line up one-to-one; but because the
//! table cannot express a per-station series there is nothing to reconcile. The single best
//! ask anywhere is the same number the audit uses as "what this costs to buy", and the same
//! number a player sees at the top of the book, so that is the one the chart is drawn around.
//!
//! ### It cannot move a price
//!
//! Nothing here writes `seed_stock`, `seed_buy_orders`, the summaries or the manifest's
//! prices; it only reads the finished book. `market-seederv3 audit` must therefore come back
//! byte-identical with history on or off, and that is the check the piece is verified with.
