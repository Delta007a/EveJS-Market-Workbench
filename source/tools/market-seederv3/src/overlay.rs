//! Bucket C — the TQ NPC catalog overlay (plan §2.3, §6.1 pass 1).
//!
//! TQ's NPCs sell 1,790 T1 blueprint originals, 469 skillbooks, 31 trade goods, 8 planetary
//! command centers and a handful of structure modules, at ~5,000 authentic stations, and they
//! buy trade goods back at another ~80,000 station/type pairs. None of that is computable
//! from the SDE: it only exists as live orders. So v3 does what v2 does — it streams the EVE
//! Ref full order snapshot and keeps the rows that look like NPC orders.
//!
//! Every rule here is a port of market-seederv2, with the `tools/market-seederv2/src/main.rs`
//! line range it came from:
//!
//! | v3 | v2 `main.rs` | what it does |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | [`EveRefOrderRow`] | `:423-441` | the CSV field set, `csv::invalid_option` on every nullable column |
//! | [`screen_row`] | `:1166-1204` | the seven rejects, **in v2's order**, then the NPC test |
//! | [`accept_order`] | `:1527-1539` | the five `[import] order_filter` modes |
//! | [`SeedLiquidity`] | `:476-529` | min-ask / max-bid collapse, quantity summed only at the kept price |
//! | [`price_to_cents`] | `:1541-1546` | prices are integer cents end to end |
//! | [`write_overlay_rows`] | `:1357-1419` | one `seed_stock` + one `seed_buy_orders` row per (station, type) |
//!
//! ### The collapse rule, and why it is not a sum
//!
//! A station holds many orders for one type. The seed tables hold **one row per
//! `(station_id, type_id)` per side**, so the book has to be flattened, and the flattening is
//! deliberately not "sum everything":
//!
//! * a **sell** row keeps the **cheapest** ask, and sums quantity only across the orders that
//!   are *at that same price*;
//! * a **buy** row keeps the **highest** bid, same rule.
//!
//! That is top-of-book, which is what a player would actually transact against. Summing every
//! order's volume into the best price would invent liquidity at a price it never had: 200
//! units offered at 5 ISK and 1,000,000 at 50 ISK would become 1,000,200 units at 5 ISK.
//!
//! ### Ordering inside the build (load-bearing)
//!
//! The build writes **this overlay first and the index + junk pass second**, because the
//! index pass uses `INSERT OR REPLACE` on the same `(station_id, type_id)` primary key and
//! must win at Jita 4-4. Written the other way round, TQ's snapshot price for a type would
//! silently replace our computed 3x-cost price at the one station the index seed owns. This
//! mirrors v2 running `write_custom_station` (`:1425-1508`) after `write_seed_liquidity`
//! (`:1357-1419`); [`crate::build::run_build`] states the same thing at the call site, and
//! `verify_seed_tables` proves it in SQL before the transaction commits.
//!
//! ### What the overlay does not touch
//!
//! Nothing here prices anything. Overlay rows carry the snapshot's own price and the
//! snapshot's own volume (plan §6.3: "NPC overlay rows keep snapshot volumes"), never the
//! int32-max quantity the index seed writes. The price manifest is not consulted and not
//! modified.
