//! Bottom-up unit-cost map — `doc/JITA_INDEX_SEED_PLAN.md` §3.3.
//!
//! ```text
//! cost(type) = SUM( qty * cost(material) ) / outputPerRun   if type has a T1 blueprint
//!            = <the leaf ladder>                            otherwise
//!
//! leaf(type)  capture-first (default) : capture -> basePrice -> needs capture
//!             base-price-first        : basePrice -> capture -> needs capture
//! ```
//!
//! The capture rung is the price manifest: [`CostInputs::captures`] carries the `ccp-*`
//! entries the manifest already holds, so a leaf resolves once its one-time capture exists
//! and everything above it in the tree resolves with it. An empty [`CapturedLeafPrices`]
//! reproduces the pre-manifest behaviour exactly.
//!
//! **Only the leaf rung has two orders** ([`crate::config::LeafPriceSource`], plan §11). The
//! recursive expansion, the per-run divide, the cycle guard and [`CostMap::server_parity_eiv`]
//! are identical either way; "3x manufacturing cost" keeps its shape and only the value of
//! its inputs moves. The default is `capture-first` because the seed must charge for an input
//! exactly what it charges for that input as a product — see [`crate::config::LeafPriceSource`]
//! for the money pumps the other order opens.
//!
//! Four properties this module exists to guarantee:
//!
//! 1. **The per-run divide is mandatory.** 307 bucket-A products yield more than one unit
//!    per run (missiles are 100/run), so the blueprint's material value is a *run* value,
//!    not a unit price. Forgetting the divide is the plan's #1 way to ship absurd prices
//!    (§8.2).
//! 2. **Only T1-blueprint producers expand.** A material that is itself manufacturable T1
//!    recurses; everything else is a leaf. T2/faction materials are leaves *by design* —
//!    they have blueprints, but expanding them would price invented goods off their T1
//!    inputs and would contradict §2.5 ("never seeded" is not "never priced as an input",
//!    but their cost basis is their market price, not their build).
//! 3. **Needs-capture propagates.** A product whose tree contains any unpriced leaf is
//!    itself unpriced, and carries the set of leaf typeIDs responsible. An A∪B type that
//!    is still unpriced at build time is dropped and named rather than seeded at a guess
//!    (§4.1, see [`crate::seedplan`]), so the seeder has to be able to say exactly which
//!    leaves the one-time CCP capture (§4.2) must fetch.
//! 4. **Nothing ever resolves to 0.** A zero price would seed a free item. Every path that
//!    would produce 0 (no materials, all-zero material sum, absent basePrice) ends at
//!    `NeedsCapture` instead.
//!
//! Two costs coexist in this file and must not be confused:
//!
//! * [`CostMap::resolve`] — the **seeder's** unit cost, per-unit, deep, capture-aware.
//! * [`CostMap::server_parity_eiv`] — the **game's** job-tax EIV, per-run, one level deep,
//!   basePrice-only. It exists solely to diff against the Node server (plan §9's
//!   "sample-diff script Node vs Rust").
